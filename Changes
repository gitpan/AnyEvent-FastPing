TODO: rcvbuf/sndbuf, arp cache size

2.02  Mon Oct 13 13:14:40 CEST 2014
	- fix a bug in the checksumming algorithm.

2.01  Sun Feb  6 01:23:25 CET 2011
	- add_hosts now allows mixed ipv4 and ipv6 addresses.
	- netbsd and solaris lack PTHREAD_STACK_MIN. sigh.

2.0   Wed Feb  2 21:20:11 CET 2011
	- use completely different object-oriented API. more complex, but
          also much more flexible.
        - support host lists in addition to ranges.
        - support per-pinger receive callbacks, no more global callback stuff.
	- no longer embed floating point values in packet, to avoid relying
          on isnormal.
        - use slightly faster ipv4 checksumming function.
        - better cope with high overload conditions by using exponential backoff.
        - add missing - sigh - common::sense dependency.

1.15  Sun Jan 30 00:55:10 CET 2011
	- famous last words: final 1.x API release.
        - bin/fastping didn't support ipv4 anymore, due to a thinko :/.

1.14  Sun Jan 30 00:36:19 CET 2011
	- likely last 1.x release.
	- use common sense.
        - convert to AE API.
        - convert bin/fastping to AnyEvent::Socket, so Socket6 is
          no longer required.
        - enable ipv6 on freebsd, netbsd, openbsd, as it seems they
          got thier header file horrors sorted out.
        - enable on cygwin, which lacks netinet/icmp6.h, but otherwise
          might work (untested).

1.13  Wed Apr  7 16:12:38 CEST 2010
	- fix prototype of register_cb to match documentation.

1.12  Tue Nov 17 22:37:48 CET 2009
	- enhance portability slightly.
        - convert to c89.

1.11  Sun May 18 22:09:13 CEST 2008
	- fix #ifdef APPLE logic. why does apple actively hurt
          free sofwtare development so much?
        - restore ipv6 support on non-broken==non-darwin platforms.

1.1   Sat May 17 23:47:05 CEST 2008
	- try to improve portability here and there.

1.0   Sun Apr 27 17:43:24 CEST 2008
	- rename from Net::FPing to AnyEvent::FastPing.

0.9   Tue May 15 21:24:22 CEST 2007
	- document net-fping output format.
        - count iterations from 1 in net-fping.
        - clarified license.

0.02  Sun May  6 01:16:52 CEST 2007
        - randomise the magic number used a bit so multiple net-fpings
          running on the same host do not see each others' replies.
        - net-fping did not accept its floating-point arguments.
        - add -h and usage to net-fping.
        - skip ping tests when !root.
